# <user based interaction password generator>

## Description



- What was your motivation?
My motivation was to learn implementation of math.random and being able to use a lot of different targeted array's
- Why did you build this project?
To test all different types of arrays and concatenation in conjunction with on another and implement a more user based result of random characters.
- What problem does it solve?
 being able to randomize characters to create a stronger more unique password
- What did you learn?
How and when to apply these new ideas in a real implementation project such as this one
